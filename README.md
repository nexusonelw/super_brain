# super_brain

This is an experimental project - the Super Brain Project - aimed at creating a super AI, a superintelligence.

What makes us human is that we have a subconscious mind, we have slow thinking and deep thinking, we have an extremely long chain of memories from birth to death, we can integrate knowledge and understanding, and we are rich in imagination. This project aims to construct something similar to a super human brain.

This project may have a very long development cycle, the operational costs may be extremely high, and it may even die before birth. None of these matter. What matters is that we have thought about it, explored it, and put it into practice.


这是一个实验项目,超级大脑计划,旨在创建一个超级ai,超智能体.

人之所以为人,是因为我们有潜意识,我们有慢思考,长思考,有从出生到死亡的非常长的记忆链条,我们能融汇贯通,富有想象力,这个项目就是要构建一个类似于超级人脑的项目,
可能这个项目的开发周期会很长,可能运行成本非常高.也可能胎死腹中,这些都不重要,重要的是我们思考过,探索过,实践过
